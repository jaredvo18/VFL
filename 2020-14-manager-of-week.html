        This Manager Of The Week Award goes to Hunter, who scored an astounding 155.64 points over the second highest scoring team this week!
      </p>

      <h4 class="article-subheader">Interview With Hunter</h4>

      <p class="article-content">
        Jared: "What are your overall thoughts from the win this week and how does it feel to become the 1st Manager Of The Week Award Winner?"
      </p>
      <p class="article-content">
        <strong>Hunter: "I am very happy for this win especially because I lost the previous 5 matchups. I did not want to lose again especially because I believe I have one
          of the best teams in the league. I did score the most points so far in the league so I'm very happy to be the first manager of the week and it definitely won't be my last."</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="article-content">
        Jared: "Was there any of your starters this week that you almost didn't play that ended up performing well?"
      </p>
      <p class="article-content">
        <strong>Hunter: "I was very hesitant to start Johnathan Taylor but he went off for 28 points which was a huge win."</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="article-content">
        Jared: "Which one of your players surpised you the most this week?"
      </p>
      <p class="article-content">
        <strong>Hunter: "The Washington football team's defense surprised me. I knew that they were good but they put up 23 points which was huge for me."</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="article-content">
        Jared: "You missed the playoffs this year, but scored among the highest scoring teams in the league. What are your plans to improve your team next year?"
      </p>
      <p class="article-content">
        <strong>Hunter: "I am very displeased that I missed the playoffs. Like I said before, I think I had one of the best teams, I did score the most points, I just had
          some bad matchups this year that resulted in losses. Next year my plan would be to make better trades. I made a couple good trades but there's a few that I regret
          so I would be more careful when it comes to trading to not ruin my team possibly."</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="article-content">
        Jared: "Which players are you considering to be your keeper next year?"
      </p>
      <p class="article-content">
        <strong>Hunter: "Players I would consider keeping next year would be, D-Hop, Johnathan Taylor, or Ridley. I'd say Cook but I kept him last year. I don't
        think you can keep the same player twice but if I can then Cook would also be in the conversation. It would proably come down to one the RBs since good ones are hard to come by and are
        so valuable.</strong>
