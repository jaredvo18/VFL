        The playoff teams have been determined. Sitting at the 1st seed is Jared. At the 2nd seed, sits Calvin.
        The 3rd seed has been awarded to Joe and Mark just barely slipped in at the 4th seed.
      </p>
      <h4 class="article-subheader">Game 1</h4>
      <p class="article-content">
        Game 1 of the playoffs will pit #1 Jared (11-3) vs. #4 Mark (7-7). This is their 3rd matchup of the year.
        Mark won the first game and last week Jared won the second matchup. As this will be the most important game between
        these two teams this year, the first official league rivalry has been established; The MJ Bowl Rivalry.
      </p>
      <p class="article-content">
        If any of the current teams in the league would like to establish a rivalry game, please contact Jared VanOeffelen
        through the group chat or at his email: jaredvo.webdev@gmail.com. Please provide the two teams involved in the rivalry and
        a name for the rivarly game.
      </p>
      <h4 class="article-subheader">Game 2</h4>
      <p class="article-content">
        Game 2 of the playoffs will be between #2 Calvin (9-5) and #3 Joe (9-5). This will be their 2nd matchup of the year.
        Joe won the 1st game 64.92 to 51.92 back in week 8.
      </p>
      <p class="article-content">
        While Joe has scored far below the league average for points for this year, he has still managed to maintain a 9-5 record.
        Calvin started the year slowly with a 5-4 record but has only lost 1 game since then. Both teams are expected to put up
        a good fight and we all look forward to seeing who will advance to the championship and who will fall back into the Fonger Bowl.
